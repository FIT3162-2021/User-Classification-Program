What Can I Recycle?

Paper can be recycled. So can metal, plastic, and glass. Give those a rinse first.

Keep It Separated

Put each material into a different bin. This will help recycling centers sort it all out later on.

Here Comes the Truck

A recycling truck will come to take your materials away. Now they're headed to a recycling center.

Sorted Out

The materials will be sorted. They might be compressed, or crushed. They are on their way to becoming something new.

Try It!

Use items in a new way without recycling them. Try making a plastic bottle into an instrument. Plant seeds in an old egg carton."
