What Can I Recycle?

Paper can be recycled. So can metal, plastic, and glass. Give those a rinse first.

Keep It Separated

Put each material into a different bin. This will help recycling centers sort it all out later on.

Here Comes the Truck

A recycling truck will come to take your materials away. Now they're headed to a recycling center.

Sorted Out

The materials will be sorted. They might be compressed, or crushed. They are on their way to becoming something new.

Try It!

Use items in a new way without recycling them. Try making a plastic bottle into an instrument. Plant seeds in an old egg carton."

How does composting work? Tiny creatures found in soil will feast on the food scraps. They will break them down. The soil will become rich with nutrients. It can be used to grow plants.

Look at the illustration below. It shows which items should be composted and which should not. Use it to help you with your compost project."
